**TODO: hook** **TODO: rest of introduction**

**Problems in CS** Lots of people want to get started coding, but turn away as soon as they see some scary-looking
code. And to be fair, it IS scary-looking. When I started coding, lots of what I did was just rote memorization of lines of code, and which parts I could change and which parts I couldn't (at least without
breaking it to a point where I couldn't fix it). Take a look at the following block of code:

```ruby
for x in 1..10 do
    print x
end
```

Now if you are a seasoned programmer (particularly if you know Ruby), asking you to interpret this code block would be an insult to your abilities. Jeff Atwood, Co-founder of StackOverflow, wrote about
 several recruiters experiences turning down staggering amounts of job canidates for software development positions because they couldn't pass the technical portion of the interview.[^wcpp] The 
 interesting part is that they didn't forget what binary search is, or struggled to solve a brainteaser about manhole covers.[^gic] They couldn't solve basic programming problems. Some graduate students took
 upwards of 15 minutes to write the block of code displayed above.[^htgh] Now of course there are variables that can affect this like interview nervousness, the specific language being used, and possibly 
 the interviewee overthinking it. According to the article though, this has happened in interviews enough times to show that lack of logical understanding of what a given piece of code does it absolutely
 a factor here.

**Underlying problem** Dunning-Kruger effect[^dkef]

**why this matters**

**What we can do to fix** What can we do to fix this? The bad news is that Digging isn't really something that can be taught. Making a few changes to the education system isn't going to cut it.
The good news is that metacognition, the problem-solving ability behind Digging, isn't something that you need to be born with. Sure some people might have a bit of a head start with natural-born
abilities, but ultimately anyone can build this ability much like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. **TODO: Continue**

**TODO: Give kids a platform to break stuff.** If you have a computer that your kids use, install VirtualBox and make regular backups. Give them the admin password (to the guest OS) and let them break stuff. When something 
goes wrong, like when they discover the importance of the System32 directory[^kymds], just do a restore from backup. Takes up to 60 seconds to do a restore, and you can even write a script to automatically 
do the backups. If you're paranoid about a ransomware breaking out of the isolated VM[^mvmd], grab yourself an old computer from the dumpster and slap [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) or [Citrix XenServer](https://xenserver.org/) on it. Both are pretty hard to screw up 
if you find an online guide as long as you aren't doing anything crazy.

**TODO: YOUR responsibility**

Knowing where to start practicing Digging can be tricky, especially if you don't have a hobby that requires it.
