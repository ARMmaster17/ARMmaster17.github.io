I"Ø<p>A while back, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/ARMmaster17/JeffBot">Jeffbot</a> as a fun side project because I was bored between classes in college. JeffBot is simply a chatbot with the intelligence of a two-year-old. It learns words and what words can/canâ€™t be used sequentially in a sentence. At first, it spews out pure garbage or just repeats back what you just said. However, over time, JeffBot learns how to make what appears to be intelligent english.</p>
