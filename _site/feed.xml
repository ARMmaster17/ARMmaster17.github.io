        <title>Getting Started With Disco MapReduce</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I wanted to learn how to use Hadoop. I prefer to self-host my stuff as it’s free (as in pizza), and free (as in speech).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost immediately ran into issues getting it set up. First off, it turns out Hadoop uses Java, which I hate. It also has insane memory requirements, which my homelab couldn’t handle. To top it off, the installation docs were too confusing for something that I would use for 10 minutes and then never touch again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://discoproject.org&quot;&gt;Disco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Hadoop, Disco has libraries for use in Python, which I find slightly more acceptable than Java. It also has an extrememly small footprint. I was able to run a testing worker with 256mb of RAM, 1 CPU, and 1 GB of hard drive space (including all of its dependencies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one remaining problem, is that following the installation instructions for Disco has probably been one of the most frustrating pieces of software I’ve ever had to install.&lt;/p&gt;
