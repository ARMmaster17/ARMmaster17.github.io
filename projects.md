Started in 2011 with a pile of decomissioned computers, the Firecore Project is a collection of repurposed consumer-grade computers running modern virtualization and container solutions. The project serves no commercial purpose, but provides a sandbox for me to learn about emerging technologies with my own equipment (versus my employer's multi-million dollar datacenter). Current solutions and services include:
- HTTP load-balancing with Nginx.
- BIND DNS with <1 ms response time.
- IPsec VPN between all Proxmox servers.
- OpenVPN for roadwarrior access.
- MariaDB(MySQL)/MongoDB database hosting.
- Containerized Apache Spark cluster with Jupyter notebook hosting.
- LDAP central authentication.
- Container hosting with LXC/Docker.
- IMAP email service based on Postfix and Dovecot.
- On-demand game server containers (deploy time <10 seconds).
- SAN for backups/high-availability VMs.
- APT package caching/proxy for Ubuntu and Debian VMs/containers.

Internet-facing status panel coming soon.
