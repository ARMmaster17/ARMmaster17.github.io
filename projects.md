# Firecore Lab
Personal Server Cluster - **Proxmox/VMWare ESXi/RancherOS**

Started in 2011 with a pile of decomissioned computers, the Firecore Project is a collection of repurposed consumer-grade computers running modern virtualization and container solutions. The project serves no commercial purpose, but provides a sandbox for me to learn about emerging technologies with my own equipment (versus my company's multi-million dollar datacenter). Current solutions and services include:
- HTTP load-balancing with Nginx.
- BIND DNS with <1 ms response time.
- IPsec VPN between all Proxmox servers.
- OpenVPN for roadwarrior access.
- MariaDB(MySQL)/MongoDB database hosting.
- Containerized Apache Spark cluster with Jupyter notebook hosting.
- LDAP central authentication.
- Container hosting with LXC/Docker.

Web documentation coming soon.
