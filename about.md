I'm a software developer with a passion for microservices, containerization, and code delivery pipeline automation. I'm an advocate for open source software development and I am a contributor to several repositories on GitHub as well as managing my own projects. I enjoy learning new frameworks, languagesm and anything else that sounds like a fun challenge!

If your company is currently hiring junior software developers or DevOps engineers, I would love to get in contact and hear more! I am currently exploring opportunities that start in May 2022 or later. To learn more about me or to get in contact, please see my LinkedIn profile linked below.
